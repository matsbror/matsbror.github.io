      <description>The Map Pattern in Other Languages In the first post on the map pattern I showed how the pattern could be coded in C++ in a few different ways. Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at some other popular languages: Rust, Java and Python.
A caveat: I am not a day-to-day user of these languages and they are partly a mystery to me as I do not exactly know how they are translated to machine code at the end.</description>

      <description>Parallel patterns According to Wikipedia, a software design pattern is &amp;ldquo;a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design&amp;rdquo;.
As a simple example, in the context of structural design of an algorithm, a repeated access of a vector/array item for a given index can be expressed with a loop structure instead of repeatedly accessing the vector updating the index manually.</description>
